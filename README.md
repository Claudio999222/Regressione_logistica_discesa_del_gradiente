# Logistic Regression Analysis

In this notebook, we will delve into logistic regression, a fundamental algorithm for binary classification tasks. Logistic regression is employed to model the probability of a binary outcome, making it a powerful tool for scenarios where the dependent variable is categorical.

## Key Components:

1. **Sigmoid Function**: We will explore the sigmoid (logistic) function, a critical element of logistic regression that maps input values to a range between 0 and 1, representing probabilities.

2. **Cost Functions**: An examination of different cost functions used in logistic regression to evaluate the accuracy of the model's predictions.

3. **Gradient Descent**: An overview of the gradient descent algorithm applied to logistic regression, enabling the model to learn optimal parameters.

4. **Hypothesis Function**: Formulation of the hypothesis function in logistic regression, capturing the relationship between features and the binary outcome.

5. **Model Training with Sci-Kit Learn**: Implementation of logistic regression using the Sci-Kit Learn library, a convenient and efficient approach to building logistic regression models.

Through this exploration, we aim to demystify the underlying principles of logistic regression and provide practical insights into its application. Logistic regression is widely used in various fields, including healthcare, finance, and social sciences, for its ability to handle binary classification tasks effectively.
